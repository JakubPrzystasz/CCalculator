This is simple library written in C, that provides Reverse Polish Notation.

I use Visual C++ compiler, in my case everything compiles.

##Usage
It does not work fine, a lot of memory leaks, and terribly bugs!
## TODO List
- debug the code
- add trygonometric functions
- improve performance (rewrite some of code in asm)
- add LaTex support
- add plotting function
- add interactive mode
